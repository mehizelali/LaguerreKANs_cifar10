# LaguerreKANs_cifar10

This repository implements a **Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Network (KAN)** using **Laguerre basis functions**, trained on the **CIFAR-10** image classification dataset. The entire implementation is done using **PyTorch**.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks (KANs) are a novel architecture inspired by the Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold representation theorem. Instead of traditional neurons, KANs use learnable basis functions to approximate complex functions. In this project, we use **Laguerre polynomials** as the basis set.

The goal is to evaluate the performance of Laguerre-based KANs on standard vision tasks like CIFAR-10 classification.
